# property-inference-framework
Modular framework for property inference attacks on deep neural networks

## Attacks

 * __White-Box__: Threat model in which we have access to the model's parameters directly
 * __Grey-Box__: Threat model in which we have only query access to the model, but we know the model's architecture and hyperparameters
 * __Black-Box__: Threat model in which we do only have query access to the model, and no other information
